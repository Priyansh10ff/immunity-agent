"""Retroactively upgrade existing feed advisories with better titles, types,
actions, and deduplicated references.

MAINTAINER TOOL — NOT for end users. Re-writing the feed invalidates the
Ed25519 signature and breaks `immunity audit`. Run this only in CI where
PRISMOR_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY is available so the feed is re-signed in the
same step.

Behaviour:
  - No changes needed           → exit 0 without touching the file (signature
                                  stays valid).
  - Changes applied in CI       → feed is re-signed automatically via
                                  pipeline/sign_feed.sh.
  - Changes applied locally     → warn loudly that the signature is now
                                  stale; `immunity audit` will fail until the
                                  user re-clones or a signed feed is pulled.
