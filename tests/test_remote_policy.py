"""Tests for signed remote (org-managed) policy distribution.

Invariants:
  * A correctly-signed remote policy is applied (can add rules / settings).
  * A signed remote policy still CANNOT disable a non-overridable core rule.
  * A tampered / unsigned remote policy is ignored entirely (fail-closed).
