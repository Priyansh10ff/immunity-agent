"""Tests for per-workspace scoping (managed vs personal).

Invariants:
  * Not enrolled → always local (nothing to report to).
  * Org claims a repo (pattern) → managed, and a developer CANNOT downgrade it.
  * No patterns set → manage everything (backward-compatible), but a dev can
    opt a personal repo out.
  * Patterns set → non-matching repos are personal by default; dev can opt in.
  * git remote detection from .git/config (https + ssh forms).
