"""Offline spool for control-plane telemetry — at-least-once upload.

The ``prismor`` sink (sinks.py) uploads telemetry records synchronously and
best-effort. When the control plane is unreachable (offline laptop, cold DB,
outage), records used to be dropped. Instead they are appended here — a JSONL
file at ``$PRISMOR_HOME/telemetry-spool.jsonl`` — and drained into the next
successful upload, so org observability survives outages without ever
blocking or retrying on the hot path.

Properties:

* **Bounded.** The spool keeps at most ``SPOOL_MAX_RECORDS`` records (oldest
  dropped first); a runaway outage can't grow an unbounded file.
* **Concurrent-safe.** Hook invocations from parallel agent processes
  serialize on an ``fcntl`` lock around every read-modify-write.
* **Privacy-preserving.** Records are spooled *after* the telemetry redaction
  boundary (warden/telemetry.py), so the file never contains anything that
  wasn't already cleared to leave the machine.
* **Best-effort.** Every function swallows OSError — a broken spool degrades
  to the old drop-on-failure behavior, never to a blocked tool call.
