# Warden

Warden hooks into the agent's tool-use pipeline before the action reaches the OS. The command is evaluated against your policy before it is executed. If the policy says block, the shell never sees it.

## Policy Engine

Prismor's policy engine is YAML-driven and configurable per-project:

- Every rule has an `id`, severity, category, event type, and pattern list. All fields are editable.
- Your project's `.prismor-warden/policy.yaml` overrides defaults by `id` at runtime
- Allowlists suppress false positives without disabling entire rule categories
- `immunity policy edit` lets you toggle rules interactively without touching YAML

```yaml
rules:
  # Disable a default rule for this project
  - id: risky-write
    enabled: false

  # Add a project-specific rule
  - id: block-prod-db
    severity: CRITICAL
    category: db_access
    title: Block production database access
    event_types: [shell]
    fields: [command]
    patterns: ["psql.*prod", "mysql.*production"]
    action: block

allowlists:
  - id: allow-test-env
    rule_ids: ["secret-access"]
    patterns: ["\\.env\\.test$"]
    reason: "Test env file has no real secrets"
```

Commit the policy file to share rules across your team. CI picks it up automatically.

See [`warden/default_policy.yaml`](../warden/default_policy.yaml) for the complete rule list.

| Category                  | Severity | What It Does                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Destructive commands      | CRITICAL | Blocks `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`, `dd` to disk, `shutdown`, `reboot`      |
| Secret exfiltration       | CRITICAL | Blocks `cat .env \| curl`, piping secrets to external hosts        |
| DoS / resource exhaustion | CRITICAL | Blocks fork bombs, while-true loops, `/dev/urandom` abuse          |
| RCE / reverse shells      | CRITICAL | Blocks `bash -i /dev/tcp`, crontab injection, `ncat` listeners     |
| Privilege escalation      | CRITICAL | Blocks `chmod +s`, sudoers edits, `useradd`, `setcap`              |
| Prompt injection          | HIGH     | Detects "ignore instructions", "reveal system prompt" in agent I/O |
| Remote execution          | HIGH     | Blocks `curl \| bash`, `wget \| sh` fetch-and-execute chains       |
| Skill prompt override     | HIGH     | Flags "ignore instructions", persona hijack in skill prompts       |
| Skill secret access       | HIGH     | Flags skills referencing `.env`, `.ssh/id_rsa`, `.aws/credentials` |
| Skill overpermission      | MEDIUM   | Flags skills requesting wildcard filesystem or network access      |

## Session Logs

Warden logs every agent tool interaction, not just findings. This gives you a full audit trail of what your agent did, not just what it was blocked from doing.

| Tool type          | Fields captured         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Shell (Bash)       | command, stdout, stderr |
| File read          | path                    |
| File write         | path, content           |
| Web fetch / search | url, response           |
| User prompt        | prompt text             |

All events are stored under `.prismor-warden/` in your project:

- `.prismor-warden/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl` is an append-only log with one JSON object per tool call
- `.prismor-warden/warden.db` is a SQLite database indexed for fast querying across sessions

## Security Audit

Run a single command to check your entire security posture across hooks, policy, cloaking, permissions, and network isolation:

```bash
immunity audit               # full security posture check
immunity audit --fix         # auto-remediate fixable issues
immunity audit --json        # machine-readable output
```

| Check              | What it verifies                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hook integrations  | Are Warden hooks installed? Which agents? Enforce or observe mode? |
| Policy coverage    | Are all default rules active? Any disabled?                        |
| Cloaking status    | Are cloaking hooks installed? Secrets registered?                  |
| Secret permissions | Are `~/.prismor/secrets/` permissions correct (0700/0600)?         |
| Egress allowlist   | Is outbound network lockdown configured?                           |
| Network isolation  | Are all network isolation rules enabled?                           |

Issues that can be auto-fixed (like installing missing hooks or correcting file permissions) are marked `[fixable]`. Run `immunity audit --fix` to apply them. The exit code reflects the worst severity found: `2` for critical, `1` for high/medium, `0` for clean.

## Setup

### Interactive (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrismorSec/prismor.git ~/.prismor
bash ~/.prismor/scripts/init.sh .
```

The setup wizard lets you:

1. Choose enforcement mode (`observe` or `enforce`)
2. Toggle detection rules on/off. Each rule shows exactly what it catches.
3. Select which agents to hook (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenClaw, Hermes)
4. Review and confirm before installing

After setup, restart your shell and the `warden` command is available from any directory.

### Non-interactive (CI)

```bash
PRISMOR_MODE=enforce bash ~/.prismor/scripts/init.sh /path/to/project --non-interactive
```

## Integration Templates

For projects not using `init.sh`:

- [`templates/CLAUDE.md.template`](../templates/CLAUDE.md.template) for Claude Code
- [`templates/.cursorrules.template`](../templates/.cursorrules.template) for Cursor
